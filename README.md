# Mental Health Assistant Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to create a Mental Health Assistant chatbot using sentiment analysis to provide supportive and uplifting messages based on the user's emotional state. By integrating **Llama 2**, **Hugging Face's sentiment analysis model**, and other tools, the chatbot can detect when users are feeling down or upset and adjust its responses accordingly. 

The goal of this project is to offer a more interactive and emotionally aware chatbot that can assist with mental health support by:

1. **Sentiment Detection**: Analyzing user input to determine the emotional tone (positive, neutral, or negative) using Hugging Face models.
2. **Adaptive Responses**: The chatbot adjusts its replies based on the detected sentiment, offering supportive messages when necessary.
3. **Interactive Conversations**: By using Llama 2, the chatbot generates meaningful, context-aware, and concise responses, especially when users express negative emotions.
4. **Learning from User Inputs**: The chatbot stores questions and answers, building its knowledge base to better respond to future inquiries.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects whether user input is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Customized Responses**: Provides supportive responses when negative sentiment is detected, or positive reinforcements for positive input.
- **Llama 2 for Response Generation**: Uses Llama 2's text generation capabilities to create concise and context-appropriate replies.
- **Self-Learning**: The chatbot stores user questions and generated responses for future reference.
  
## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: The core programming language used to build the chatbot.
- **Google Colab**: Used to develop and run the chatbot in an accessible environment.
- **Hugging Face Sentiment Model**: Provides sentiment analysis for user input.
- **Llama 2**: Generates context-based responses to user queries.
- **Pandas**: For storing and managing a QA dataset of user inputs and answers.
